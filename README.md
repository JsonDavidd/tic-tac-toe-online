Hello! this project comes from an idea that I seen in a video.

Tic Tac Toe online will be first a simple classic game that connects you to another player to play in realtime. But later it will be a game that follows the rules below

- 1. Instead of just O and X characters there will be custom cards
- 2. Each player will have 5 cards
- 3. Each card will be bigger than the previous one
- 4. Big cards could superpose over or "eat" smaller ones

I would love your participation!

Now the project is based on NextJS, also it has installed Tailwind and Firebase.
